# PocketCode Project Status

**Status:** Discovery and product definition  
**Project name:** PocketCode is provisional; brand and repository naming are not validated.  
**Repository:** https://github.com/marcelosofficial-ctrl/PocketCode-

## Mission

Help people build, execute, inspect, and improve software from a phone, including when they do not have access to a computer.

## Current product hypothesis

A mobile-first, provider-neutral workspace could make AI-generated code genuinely useful by letting users run it in an appropriate environment, inspect real execution evidence, and carry that evidence into any AI assistant for debugging and iteration. This is a hypothesis to validate, not a proven market advantage.

## Current phase

Discovery, competitive research, and MVP definition. No production architecture, runtime provider, monetization model, or public brand commitment has been approved.

## Working MVP direction

- Mobile-first responsive web application/PWA as the first testable interface.
- Start with one real, isolated remote runtime, likely Python.
- Paste or upload code and supporting files.
- Run with explicit timeout and cancellation behavior.
- Show stdout, stderr, exit status, and generated files where supported.
- Preserve a small, understandable execution history.
- Make actual execution evidence easy to copy/share with any AI provider.
- No mandatory AI-provider lock-in.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim code execution works until an actual execution path and tests demonstrate it.
- Treat submitted code as untrusted.
- Never put credentials, API keys, tokens, private user data, or production secrets in this public repository.
- Do not execute untrusted code directly on the application server or developer workstation.
- Avoid promising every language or unrestricted OS access.
- No paid infrastructure, external service commitments, or irreversible actions without explicit owner approval.
- Keep assumptions separate from verified facts.
- PocketCode is separate from RevDev.

## Immediate next steps

1. Interview likely users to test whether the main pain is running AI-generated code from a phone, debugging it, or building complete apps.
2. Test the working positioning hypothesis in [MARKETING/POSITIONING_HYPOTHESIS.md](MARKETING/POSITIONING_HYPOTHESIS.md); do not treat the slogan as validated.
3. Compare the strongest two hosted sandbox options against the acceptance tests, current pricing, isolation, and data-retention constraints.
4. Create a small, testable Python execution proof before building a full application.
5. Use real test evidence to decide whether to proceed to a mobile UI prototype.
6. Revisit the provisional name before investing in a final brand or domain.

## Progress log

- Repository created by owner and made public.
- Initial README exists; its current wording is temporary.
- Initial product hypothesis and working documents established.
- Added a working vibe-coding marketing/positioning hypothesis and updated the README headline; positioning is not customer-validated.
- 2026-10-20: Reviewed the architectural specification pasted by the owner from Gemini. Added [AI_COLLAB/CHATGPT_REVIEW_OF_GEMINI_PLAN.md](AI_COLLAB/CHATGPT_REVIEW_OF_GEMINI_PLAN.md) with an independent desk review, a scoped MVP recommendation, provider/cost caveats, security launch gates, and proposed test IDs. This is not a provider selection or implementation proof; no code, paid workload, customer interview, benchmark, or live security test was run. The pasted Gemini specification has not been verified as a canonical repository update.

- 2026-10-20: Added [AI_COLLAB/MVP_DECISION_BRIEF.md](AI_COLLAB/MVP_DECISION_BRIEF.md), a sourced desk-research shortlist for Cloudflare Sandbox Containers, Modal Sandboxes, and Daytona Sandboxes, plus provider gates, a narrow vertical slice, proposed test IDs, and implementation sequencing. No provider selected and no live test performed.

- 2026-10-20: Added [PRODUCT/EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md](PRODUCT/EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md) defining a proposed provider-neutral run lifecycle, request/result fields, idempotency, cancellation, file safety, egress/security expectations, report format, and 14 proposed API acceptance tests. This is design documentation only; no API is implemented.

- 2026-10-20: Added a self-contained mobile UI prototype at `prototypes/mobile-runner/index.html`. It is responsive and offers sample success/error states; all output is simulated, and no backend or code execution is implemented. Browser interaction tests have not yet been run.
